Simple diffusive lattice Boltzmann using Pandas data structures

This was written to test my ability to implement and manipulate pandas data structures
This simulation is extremely slow as compared to writing this in C, however, this version implements modern data science techniques
and is designed to be used as a learning tool. It does imply basic knowledge of the lattice Boltzmann method.

This simulation is currently implemented as a simple one dimensional diffusive system.

I plan to modify and add functionality as I learn more,

DISCLAIMER: This code is not intended for any practical simulation implementation due to the fact that it is very slow. It is only meant to be a playground for learning data science techniques in a novel manner.

#### Planned Improvements ####
 1) Remove need for global variables
 2) Generalize to multi-dimensions
 3) Add machine learning methods
