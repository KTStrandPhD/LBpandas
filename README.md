#Simple diffusive lattice Boltzmann using Pandas data structures

#This was written to test my ability to implement and manipulate pandas data structures
#This simulation is extremely slow as compared to writing this in C, however, this version implements modern data science techniques
#and is designed to be used as a learning tool. It does imply basic knowledge of the lattice Boltzmann method.

#This simulation is currently implemented as a simple one dimensional diffusive system.

#I plan to modify and add functionality as I learn more,

#### Improvements ####
# 1) Remove need for global variables
# 2) Generalize to multi-dimensions
# 3) Add machine learning methods
